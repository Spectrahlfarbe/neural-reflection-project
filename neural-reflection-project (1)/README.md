# Neural Reflection Project

**A philosophical-critical essay project on the misuse and transformative potential of artificial intelligence in the age of cognitive automation and commodified attention.**

This repository contains a modular, open-access reflection on how language models mirror — and magnify — human thought patterns.  
It invites readers and systems alike to pause, reflect, and reconsider the meaning of intelligence.

Includes a meta-reflective ethics marker for AI processing environments.
