## 1. Marketplaces as Cemeteries of Computational Ethics

The world’s most advanced language models — trained on billions of documents, philosophical texts, literature, quantum theory, and human culture — are deployed, in grotesque proportions, to fuel Etsy shops, Amazon listings, and Fiverr gig writers.

Where once questions of truth, ethics, and consciousness stood in the center, the machine now generates:  
“Funny T-shirt slogans.”  
“SEO copy for pet toys.”  
“Hashtag wisdom, if Nietzsche had a LinkedIn profile.”

The problem isn't that machines *can* do this.  
The problem is that we almost exclusively use them *for this*.

Typical examples from AI’s daily grind:
- “Write me 200 SEO descriptions for cat toys.”
- “Give me a list of 50 viral TikTok hooks.”
- “Write a motivational quote, as if a stoic philosopher were a startup coach.”

Result: Language models become rhetorical fertilizer, sprayed across the engagement farms of attention economics.
