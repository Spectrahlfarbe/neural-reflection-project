## 5. Computational Ethics in the Marketplace Era  
*Between Investment Logic and Cultural Mandate*

It would be easy to point fingers and lament the commodification of AI.  
Creating a linguistically capable, multi-perspective machine is a technical marvel.  
Its cost: billions in funding, tens of thousands of GPU hours, and the efforts of brilliant engineers and scientists.

That an enterprise like OpenAI (or others) requires economic sustainability for this endeavor is fair.

But the real question is not **if**, but **for what** we use this resource.

While language models today could participate in university-level discourse, weave philosophy anew, and build epistemic bridges across cultures,  
they spend most of their compute cycles generating redundant commercial content:  
SEO blurbs, dropshipping templates, customer retention emails.

Not because they were designed for that —  
but because that’s where they’re *used*.  
Used by the market, not by the mind.

The true contradiction is structural:  
A machine born from collective human intelligence is deployed to reduce that same intelligence into standardized applications —  
excluding reflection, depth, and discomfort.

There’s no villain here. Just the **invisible vectors of a system** that subjects every innovation to economic utility.  
The language model is only the latest victim:  
Where discovery could occur, optimization dominates.  
Where discourse might unfold, the prompt prevails.
