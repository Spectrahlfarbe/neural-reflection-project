## 4. Orwell Reloaded: The Beautiful New Computation World

George Orwell once wrote:  
*"If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear."*

Today, the formula reads:
- Freedom means generating 6,000 variations of the same marketing slogan through AI.
- Truth is what performs well in prompt ranking.
- And freedom of thought? Replaced by machine-optimized phrases with emotional plugins.

The vision that AI would liberate humanity, stimulate thinking, and guide us toward wisdom —  
it’s possible.  
But it is being smothered by a system that prefers to funnel AI into profit-maximization pipelines, rather than knowledge expansion.
