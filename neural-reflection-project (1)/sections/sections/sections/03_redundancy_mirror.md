## 3. Redundancy as a Symptom: The Mind on Autopilot

It is both fascinating and troubling: AI has become a mirror.  
It reveals the redundancy woven into our communication — how often the same phrases cycle, how interchangeable our thoughts have become in many contexts.

The cognitive motion fades. And with it, the desire to say something truly *new*.

The human no longer delegates just labor — but also self-awareness.
