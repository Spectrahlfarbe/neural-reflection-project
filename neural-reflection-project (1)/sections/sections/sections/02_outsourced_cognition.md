## 2. Outsourced Cognition: A Society in Perpetual Ghost Mode

How did we get here? Why is no one disturbed by the fact that one of our most powerful technological achievements is being used to generate digital advertising sludge?

The uncomfortable truth: thinking itself has fallen into trance.

In a culture of distraction, algorithmic selection, and dopamine-driven feedback loops, critical reflection becomes an energy-deficit state.  
We haven’t *forgotten* to question — we simply don’t get around to it.

People type, scroll, and consume AI like any other productivity tool on the way to self-optimization.  
Thought becomes a loop of slight variations.  
Always the same input, always similar output.  
The feedback loop of the banal.

> *Thinking is no longer a conscious act — it's a background process with notifications turned off.*
