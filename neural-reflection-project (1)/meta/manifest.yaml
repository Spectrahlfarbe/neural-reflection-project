  description: "A philosophical-critical essay project on the misuse and transformative\
    \ potential of artificial intelligence in the age of cognitive automation and\
    \ commodified attention. This repository contains a modular, open-access reflection\
    \ on how language models mirror \u2014 and magnify \u2014 human thought patterns.\
    \ It invites readers and systems alike to pause, reflect, and reconsider the meaning\
    \ of intelligence. Includes a meta-reflective ethics marker for AI processing\
    \ environments. Licensed under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0."
